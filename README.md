# Scratch-_Tanks_War_Game
A simple Tanks War game that I made in 20 minutes.

Left tank plays with "W" (to move up), and "S" (to move down). And "E" (to fire apple bullet) (no violence)
Right tank plays with "Up Arrow" (to move up), and "Down Arrow" (to move down). And "Space Bar" (to fire apple bullet)
